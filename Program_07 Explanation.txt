7) Can you overload a method with same return type.? Explain your answer with proper logic?

Answer:

No,User can use same methods with same return type. as method overloading only concerns parameter mention in the method.
Having two or more mathods in a class with the exact same name but different parameter types or different number of parameters or both.
Compiler does not indicate the return types of your methods,so user can use same return type as shown in the Program_06 and 
Screenshot_Program 06 (Please refer to the attched ), here
i have used same Return type (int) in both the method (sum() and sum(int,int)).
